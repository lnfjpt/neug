/**
 * @brief NeuG database service facade for remote TP workloads.
 *
 * NeugDBService coordinates a TP runtime and an IServiceTransport. The default
 * transport uses BRPC to expose HTTP endpoints; query execution and transaction
 * ownership remain in the runtime, independently of the network handlers.
 *
 * This is the C++ equivalent of Python's `Database.serve()` functionality,
 * designed for high-throughput Transaction Processing (TP) scenarios where
 * multiple clients need concurrent access to the database.
 *
 * **Usage Example:**
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include <neug/main/neug_db.h>
 * #include <neug/server/neug_db_service.h>
 *
 * int main() {
 *   // 1. Open the database
 *   neug::NeugDB db;
 *   db.Open("/path/to/graph", 8);  // 8 threads
 *
 *   // 2. Create and configure service
 *   neug::ServiceConfig config;
 *   config.query_port = 10000;
 *   config.host_str = "0.0.0.0";
 *
 *   // 3. Start and block until shutdown (Ctrl+C or Stop from another thread).
 *   {
 *     neug::NeugDBService service(db, config);
 *     service.run_and_wait_for_exit();
 *   }
 *
 *   // 4. Close after service resources have been released.
 *   db.Close();
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * **HTTP Endpoints:**
 * - `POST /cypher` - Execute Cypher queries
 * - `GET /schema` - Retrieve graph schema
 * - `GET /service_status` - Check service status
 * - `POST /transactions` - Begin an explicit TP transaction session
 * - `POST /transactions/{id}/query|commit|rollback` - Operate on a session
 *
 * **Thread Safety:** All public methods are thread-safe. The service uses
 * a TpExecutionSlotPool internally to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
 *
 * @see ExecutionSlot for execution slot-based query execution
 * @see TpExecutionSlotPool for execution slot management
 * @since v0.1.0
